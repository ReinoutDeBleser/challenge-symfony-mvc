## The Mission
Today we are going to install Symfony, and then make some small pages and functionality using the MVC, Routing and Twig component.

## Challenge description
musthave:  
Challenge consisting of 6 steps and a bit of required reading for symfony and general software version concepts.   
Step 1: Details installing Symfony to start working with it and prep a vhost.   
Step 2: Refresher on MVC and how to use it in Symfony. as well as getting started with it in symfony using some basic commands.   
Step 3: Really start working with Symfony.   
Step 4: Basic page modification and routing using a twig helper.  
Step 5: Forwarding the user to a page using twig requiring him to provide a name.   
Step 6: Change the name of the route.   
nice to have: 
use session bag instead of '$_SESSION'

complex: use a symfony form for the change name form 


##Strategy 
follow the steps carefully for the installation. I'd prefer not to lose time having to install again because of unnecessary haste. 
We are doing this project in symfony 5 always double check if i'm using documentation for 5.
